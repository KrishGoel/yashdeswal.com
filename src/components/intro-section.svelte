                I love Debating, Coding and Maths. I've attended over 21 MUN conferences, and won several awards. I've had a keen interest in coding since 9th grade and have made several collaborative projects and conceptual tech ideas that would help simplify the world's complexities.

                I regularly update myself on world politics and am constantly watching numberphile videos and trying to prepare for the JEE.
