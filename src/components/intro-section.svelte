                My avid interest in Mathematics is satiated through the personal research I carry out in the field, ranging from watching Numberphile videos to professional research papers. This desire for knowledge has also permeated across subjects, leading me to update myself on world politics regularly. Finally, as any aspiring engineering student, I am currently preparing for the JEE.
